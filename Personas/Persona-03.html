			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
			<p>Persona is not able to paint, but he is taking violin classes and wishes to become a chemistry associated professor in the university where he studies. After a hard day of academic effort, persona feels the need to relax through any artistic means possible. This is when his mother supervises him trying the application for the first time and explains to him what the generated visual concept consists of and how it changes based on the voice recognition system. At first, persona needs to be assisted during this process, but then he learns how to use this application alone and becomes less frustrated for not being able to take his artistic skills to a professional level. He has now learned how to generate the figures of chemical structures and processes and this helps him easily understand the new information he has to deal with on the higher education program.</p>
