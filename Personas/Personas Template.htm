					<h5>Main Points</h5>
					<p>Working for creative campaigns qualifies this title for being elligible as a persona.
					</p>
					<p>Persona hates working on a nine to five schedule, and since this is impossible all kinds of creative methods are welcome.</p>
					<p>When persona uses this application, the problem solving cognitive functions are activated in order to perform further tasks.</p>
					<p>Being unable to communicate and share ideas with other people involved in the campaign makes persona incapacitated in choosing the right concept for the ad. An application to help him focus on the most concept-based idea is more than useful.</p>
					<p>The creative strategy must be ready in as little time as possible, and being deadline-centered requires concentration and keeping a ood perspective. Visually representing an idea helps prioritize concepts according to relevance criteria</p>
				</div>
				<div class="leftGroup">
					<h5>Goals</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Practical Goals: respecting deadlines, generating RoI (Return on Investment), genereting buzz</li>
						<li>Personal Goals: increasing the level of focus, coping better with stress</li>
						<li>Business Goals: being able to provide the viable solution to a campaign in as little time as possible</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div itemprop="description" class="detailsRight">
				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>Working in advertising requests a high capacity to work under pressure, reason for which the persona we are talking about is most of the times stressed and also needs new sources of inspiration during different moments of a campaign.</p>
				<p>Persona has no time to discuss the ideas during a campaign due to short time and effectiveness reasons, and needs to keep focus and keep a perspective on what he is doing. The work life is stressful, reason for which the application helps prioritize and select the best ideas by visually representing them and generating the function of further cognitive functions that otherwise cannot be accessed. Persona has little or no time for social life, he is a top employee, has few close friends and does not have the habit of going out other than in some usual places he is used to frequenting. Teamwork is very helpful for persona, mainly because it provides feedback but it is almost impossible to do this during most of the time while working on a creative strategy. Same applies for anyone else who believes that professional life is more important than personal life and is very involved in maintaining a good performance and who works in a domain requiring both a high level of concentration and creativity.</p>

				<h5>Frustrations and Pain Points</h5>
					<p>Some of the difficulties the user might have with the product.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Not being able to visually represent all the concepts behind the campaign;</li>
						<li>Not guaranteeing productivity;</li>
						<li>The slippery slope of procrastination;</li>
						<li>Not providing feedback.</li>
					</ul>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="personaScenarios">
			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
			<p>As he works on a creative strategy for a client, persona needs to focus while taking into consideration numerouss other important factors that determine how the concept is going to look like, such as the client's preferences, the deadline, the habit of consumption of the target for which the product or service that is being advertised etc. Not having the possibility to generate a more efficient thinking strategy in order to come up with the best idea in the shortest time makes persona frustrated. This is when he needs our application. During the creative process, the application is going to make the cognitive functions of the creativity level work properly, by visually representing the thoughts and concepts of persona. This type of representation is not going to be relevant for the campaign, but is certainly going to generate a cognitive process of free association during which the flow of ideas is spreading larger, just like a giant spider web. After these processes are being started, persona begins to gain a perspective over the most appropriate concept and the creative strategy as a whole. </p>

		<div class="otherDetails">
			<h5>Other Details</h5>
			<p>Not providing any feedback makes persona more efficient and competitive in generating solutions. </p>
