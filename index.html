<a name="about" class="anchor" href="#about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Sinaesthetic?</h3>

<p>Sinaesthetic is a draw-by-sound web application. A sound recognition system takes user input, parses it and controls the application based on the recognised sounds. Take a look at the <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a> (currently available only for the Chrome browser) to get a glimpse of the Sinaesthetic prototype:</p>

<h3>
  <a name="interaction" class="anchor" href="#interaction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
Application interaction</h3>
</h3>
<p> The user can interact through the application by sound or mouse. Sound input is received by voice and the feedback is provided
  through app recorded sounds and text to speech.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="concepts" class="anchor" href="#concepts"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
Application concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Voice driven drawing: </strong> The application provides voice controls for drawing.
Besides the usual editing commands like save, empty and restore, voice controls include selecting a colour, a paint tool, positioning it on the canvas drawing.</p>
</p>
<p><strong>Painting to sound:</strong> The application is able to replay a painting through sound, similar to a sonar.
The painting is transformed from a two dimensional pixel map to a linear sound stream in which each pixel is transformed
to a sound. This feature will also aid accessibility for visual impaired persons.
</p>
<p><strong>Tutorials</strong> The application provides interactive tutorials through which users can learn the application
  controls.

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Identity</h3>

<p><strong>Colour scheme</strong></p>

<p>Justification of the chromatic choice for the visual identity of the application: the chromatic combination
between blue and orange is designed to be aesthetically pleasant and to emphasize the characteristics of both
colors, given the contrasting nature of this combination. These two colors are usually used in professional
circumstances for two age categories: young and middle-age, they have in common the tendency to both
concentrate and relax. It is scientifically proven that, while orange accesses the left hemisphere of the
brain, blue accesses the right one. Combining the two sets of capacities and functions of the human brain
usually helps to visually concentrate to stimuli, regardless of their nature. In other words, whenever this
chromatic combination is used, the subject is going to improve his performance of the cognitive processes of
both intellectual and artistic brain functions. There are no further suggestions regarding the gender of the
target that shold be taken into consideration, reason for which this combination is suitable for both men and
women equally.</p>
Concerning the inner given meaning of each of these colors by experts in visual arts, blue is generally
regarded as a great stimulus for patience, peace and calmness, while orange represents friendliness and
trustworthiness of the given environment, while it also covers the energy boost necessary to keeping focused.
In combination, these two colors tend to help the subject keep focused for a longer period of time. Since
it's scientifically proven that the human brain cannot remain focused for more than 20 minutes continuously,
unless there are exceptional conditions, this chromatic combination is proven to have kept the subjects
focused for more than half an hour in an unfriendly and distractive environment.

<p><strong>Naming</strong></p>

<p>Synesthezia is the cognitive capacity of the brain to mistaken a stimulus of a kind after having received it
and decoding it in another stimulus' manner. For instance, a visual stimulus can be perceived by a subject
like a sound or like a state of mind. This kind of misinterpretation of the human brain is today believed to
be a cognitive dysfunction. However, history shows, this kind of twisted cognitive perception has helped
enrich the artistic perception of great personalities, by managing to combine two different perceptions and
obtain another given feeling from their blending. In the context of this application, synesthezia is used to
metaphorically represent the two different kinds of stimuli that are used, interpreted and transformed.
Another meaning of the first part in the naming of this application (explaining the use of 'i' instead of
'y') is based on the sinus-cosine relationship and the complementarity between these two - similarly, the
two distinct senses are being transformed into a complementary result of their combination. Aesthetically
speaking, the capacity to transform an acoustic stimulus into a visual representation isn't only based on a
common act of semiosis, but also implies that there is a converging result of artistic nature, meaning that
both semiotically speaking and aesthetically at the same time, the application in itself stands for a
senzorial improvement. Concerning the semiosis, the act of decodification and representation of a stimulus
towards another one, the complexity of the reality that is represented through the initial stimulus increases
proportionally with its corespondent representation, making it not only useful but also aesthetically
pleasant. The sinus and cosinus are perceived by the human brain in an interdependent relation of
complementarity, and so are the complementary colors used in the visual identity of the application (blue and
orange), suggesting the semiotic complementarity of the senses that are being involved in the codification-
decodification-recodification-representation process implied, thus creating a visual identitary unity. </p>

Questions, Options, Criteria</h3>

<p><strong>Q1: Where to position toolbar?</strong><br/>
O: Left<br/>
O: Right<br/>
O: Top<br/>
O: Bottom<br/>
O: Left or Right and Top<br/>
O: Left or Right and Bottom<br/>
O: Left and Right<br/>
O: Top and Bottom<br/>
O: Invisible (tools activated by sounds only)<br/>
C: Familiar<br/>
C: Simmetric<br/>
C: Relevant tool grouping<br/>
C: Low user effort<br/>
C: Efficient screen space usage<br/>
C: Easy to use<br/>
C: Good canvas focus</p>

<p><i>Conclusion:</i> Popular drawing software such as Microsoft Paint or Adobe Photoshop usually have the most used
tools (pen, color selector etc.) in a toolbar on the left and some general tools (save, undo etc.) in a menu
on top. This separation helps logically group tools and keeps the user in a familiar environment. However,
the top menu is a main trait of desktop applications and the number of tools offered does not require
cascading menu grouping. In order to save screen space and center the canvas for good focus, placing the
drawing tools on the left to preserve familiarity and the general, utility tools on the right, seems like the
best solution.</p>

<p><strong>Q2: Type of sounds recognized?</strong><br/>
O: Musical notes<br/>
O: Words<br/>
C: Intuitive<br/>
C: Language independent<br/>
C: High number of possible commands<br/>
C: Easy to use</p>

<p><i>Conclusion:</i> While drawing by playing music is language independent and can create a high number of possible
commands, using actual words to draw is more intuitive and easier to use while also not restricting the
number of possible commands. Also adding the fact that it can be implemented easier and more reliable using
voice recognition engines, drawing by using words seems to be the best solution.</p>

<p><strong>Q3: How to draw using words?</strong><br/>
O: Instruction based ("move left 3 units", "brush color red" etc.)<br/>
O: Based on the physical characteristic of the sound (pitch, length etc.)<br/>
C: Easy to use<br/>
C: Intuitive<br/>
C: High accuracy</p>

<p><i>Conclusion:</i> Using exact instructions offers a much higher accuracy and ease of use and seems to be the best
solution.</p>

<h3>
<a name="demos" class="anchor" href="#demos"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>User guide and demos</h3>
<p>Sinaesthetic is an app you can use to draw using your mouse or your voice. You can save your work and come back to it, change colours, erase or identify a drawing using the sonar system. You can try Sinaesthetic yourself now: <a href="index2.html">live demo</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Left tool box</strong></p>
<p>Each icon has two modes: blue - deactivated, orange - activated. Here are the icons, from top to bottom, explained:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Pen:</strong> select this to enter drawing mode. More options will appear in the right tool box.</li>
	<li><strong>Microphone:</strong> When this button is active, the speech system is listening to commands.</li>
	<li><strong>Sound:</strong> When this button is active, the application is sending sounds (speech, sonar).</li>
	<li><strong>Play:</strong> When this button is used, the sonar is activated. It remains activated while the sonar is in use.</li>
	<li><strong>Save:</strong> When this button is pressed, your work is saved (you can view saved states in the right tool box by pressing the load button). Active while the canvas is being saved.</li>
	<li><strong>Load:</strong> Use this button to load a saved state from the persistence menu. Active when the persistence menu is open.</li>
	<li><strong>Clear:</strong> Use this button to erase all drawings from canvas.</li>
	<li><strong>Tutorials:</strong> This opens up some tutorials and info about how to use Sinaesthetic. Active when in tutorial mode.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Right tool box</strong></p>
<p>This tool bar is used in drawing mode to choose colours or brush size and form. It is structured in three sections: top section contains the current selection of colour and brush, mid section contains the available brushes, third section contains the available colours. When a brush / colour is pressed (or requested via voice control), the top section is updated.</p>
<ul>
	<li>When selecting the pen, you can view and select thickness and colour.</li>
	<li>When selecting the load button, you can view the persistence menu.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Persistence menu:</strong> When load is pressed (or requested via voice control), the persistence menu opens on the right. The persistence menu shows a preview of the previously saved drawings. When a preview is clicked the saved work is reloaded on the canvas.</p>

<img src = "images/screenshot.jpg" />

<p><strong>Voice commands</strong></p>
 
<ul>
	<li><strong>Go</strong>: Activates the drawing menu, puts the brush on the center of the canvas.</li>
	<li><strong>Up, down, left, right</strong>: Moves the brush over the canvas.</li>
	<li><strong>Stroke</strong>: Presses / releases the brush on the canvas. Each brush move when the brush is pressed will draw on the canvas. Say once to press, say again to release.</li>
	<li><strong>Small round, Big round, Small square, Big square</strong>: Change the brush type. </li>
	<li><strong>Colours</strong>: A set of predefined colors can be named by the user to change the brush color.</li>
	<li><strong>Clear</strong>: Clears the canvas.</li>
	<li><strong>Save</strong>: Save the canvas.</li>
	<li><strong>Load</strong>: Opens the persistence menu. Shows a preview of the previous work, and allows user to chose to load an item from history.</li>
	<li><strong>First, Second, Third, Forth, Fifth</strong>: Load a painting from the storage, ordered by age, with the oldest being first.</li>
	<li><strong>Play</strong>: Brings up the sonar, which will replay the current drawing to the user.</li>
</ul>
