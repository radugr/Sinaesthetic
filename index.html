<a name="about" class="anchor" href="#about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Sinaesthetic?</h3>

<p>Sinaesthetic is a draw-by-sound web application. A sound recognition system takes user input, parses it and controls the application based on the recognised sounds. Take a look at the <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a> (currently available only for the Chrome browser) to get a glimpse of the Sinaesthetic prototype:</p>

Application interaction</h3>
</h3>
<p> The user can interact through the application by sound. Input is received either by voice or music instrument sounds and the feedback is provided
  through app recorded sounds and text to speech.

Application concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Voice driven drawing: </strong> The application provides voice controls for drawing. 
Besides the usual editing commands like save, empty and restore, voice controls include selecting a color, a paint tool, positioning it on the canavas drawing.</p>
<p><strong>Sound driven drawing:</strong> The application controls can be mapped to the sounds chosen by the user, for example
  an user may chose the map the application controls to piano keys ( same as the ones described above).
</p>
<p><strong>Painting to sound:</strong> The application is able to replay a painting through sound, similar to a sonar. 
The painting is transformed from a two dimensional pixel map to a liniar sound stream in which each pixel is transformed
to a sound. This feature will also aid accesibility for visual impaired persons.  
</p>
<p><strong>Tutorials</strong> The application provides interactive tutorials through which users can learn the application
  controls.

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Identity</h3>

<p><strong>Color scheme</strong></p>

<p>Justification of the chromatic choice for the visual identity of the application: the chromatic combination 
between blue and orange is designed to be aesthetically pleasant and to emphasize the characteristics of both
colors, given the contrasting nature of this combination. These two colors are usually used in professional 
circumstances for two age categories: young and middle-age, they have in common the tendency to both 
concentrate and relax. It is scientifically proven that, while orange accesses the left hemisphere of the 
brain, blue accesses the right one. Combining the two sets of capacities and functions of the human brain 
usually helps to visually concentrate to stimuli, regardless of their nature. In other words, whenever this 
chromatic combination is used, the subject is going to improve his performance of the cognitive processes of
both intellectual and artistic brain functions. There are no further suggestions regarding the gender of the
target that shold be taken into consideration, reason for which this combination is suitable for both men and 
women equally.</p>
Concerning the inner given meaning of each of these colors by experts in visual arts, blue is generally 
regarded as a great stimulus for patience, peace and calmness, while orange represents friendliness and 
trustworthiness of the given environment, while it also covers the energy boost necessary to keeping focused. 
In combination, these two colors tend to help the subject keep focused for a longer period of time. Since 
it's scientifically proven that the human brain cannot remain focused for more than 20 minutes continuously, 
unless there are exceptional conditions, this chromatic combination is proven to have kept the subjects 
focused for more than half an hour in an unfriendly and distractive environment. 

<p><strong>Naming</strong></p>

<p>Synesthezia is the cognitive capacity of the brain to mistaken a stimulus of a kind after having recieved it 
and decoding it in another stimulus' manner. For instance, a visual stimulus can be perceived by a subject 
like a sound or like a state of mind. This kind of misinterpretation of the human brain is today believed to 
be a cognitive dysfunction. However, history shows, this kind of twisted cognitive perception has helped 
enrich the artistic perception of great personalities, by managing to combine two different perceptions and 
obtain another given feeling from their blending. In the context of this application, synesthezia is used to
metaphorically represent the two different kinds of stimuli that are used, interpreted and transformed. 
Another meaning of the first part in the naming of this application (explaining the use of 'i' instead of 
'y') is based on the sinus-cosinus relationship and the complementarity between these two - similarly, the
two distinct senses are being transformed into a complementary result of their combination. Aesthetically 
speaking, the capacity to transform an acoustic stimulus into a visual representation isn't only based on a 
common act of semiosis, but also implies that there is a converging result of artistic nature, meaning that 
both semiotically speaking and aesthetically at the same time, the application in itself stands for a 
senzorial improvement. Concerning the semiosis, the act of decodification and representation of a stimulus 
towards another one, the complexity of the reality that is represented through the initial stimulus increases 
proportionally with its corespondent representation, making it not only useful but also aesthetically 
pleasant. The sinus and cosinus are perceived by the human brain in an interdependent relation of 
complementarity, and so are the complementary colors used in the visual identity of the application (blue and 
orange), suggesting the semiotic complementarity of the senses that are being involved in the codification-
decodification-recodification-representation process implied, thus creating a visual identitary unity. </p>

Questions, Options, Criteria</h3>

<p><strong>Q1: Where to position toolbar?</strong><br/>
O: Left<br/>
O: Right<br/>
O: Top<br/>
O: Bottom<br/>
O: Left or Right and Top<br/>
O: Left or Right and Bottom<br/>
O: Left and Right<br/>
O: Top and Bottom<br/>
O: Invisible (tools activated by sounds only)<br/>
C: Familiar<br/>
C: Simmetric<br/>
C: Relevant tool grouping<br/>
C: Low user effort<br/>
C: Efficient screen space usage<br/>
C: Easy to use<br/>
C: Good canvas focus</p>

<p><i>Conclusion:</i> Popular drawing software such as Microsoft Paint or Adobe Photoshop usually have the most used 
tools (pen, color selector etc.) in a toolbar on the left and some general tools (save, undo etc.) in a menu 
on top. This separation helps logically group tools and keeps the user in a familiar environment. However, 
the top menu is a main trait of desktop applications and the number of tools offered does not require 
cascading menu grouping. In order to save screen space and center the canvas for good focus, placing the 
drawing tools on the left to preserve familiarity and the general, utility tools on the right, seems like the 
best solution.</p>

<p><strong>Q2: Type of sounds recognized?</strong><br/>
O: Musical notes<br/>
O: Words<br/>
C: Intuitive<br/>
C: Language independent<br/>
C: High number of possible commands<br/>
C: Easy to use</p>

<p><i>Conclusion:</i> While drawing by playing music is language independent and can create a high number of possible 
commands, using actual words to draw is more intuitive and easier to use while also not restricting the 
number of possible commands. Also adding the fact that it can be implemented easier and more reliable using 
voice recognition engines, drawing by using words seems to be the best solution.</p>

<p><strong>Q3: How to draw using words?</strong><br/>
O: Instruction based ("move left 3 units", "brush color red" etc.)<br/>
O: Based on the physical characteristic of the sound (pitch, length etc.)<br/>
C: Easy to use<br/>
C: Intuitive<br/>
C: High accuracy</p>

<p><i>Conclusion:</i> Using exact instructions offers a much higher accuracy and ease of use and seems to be the best 
solution.</p>
